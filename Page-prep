    <h6>In this example, we are going to add 2 packages of Bacon to start the bundles subscription, <br>
         after their firts purchase they can then use the Customer Portal to change their bundle contents.
<br>
      This is a simple example showing how you could use the SDK to create selections for a fixed-price Bundle.
<br><br>
Important: <br>Please remember that fixed-price Bundles will get their items extracted on the checkout order 
      <br> and they need the _rb_id attribute to exist in the cart line item properties.
